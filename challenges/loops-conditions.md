**Beginner:**

1.  **Looping and Summing:**

    - Write a `for` loop that iterates from 1 to 10 and calculates the sum of all numbers in that range.
    - Print the final sum to the console.

2.  **Conditional Check (Even/Odd):**

    - Write a `for` loop that iterates from 1 to 20.
    - Inside the loop, use an `if` statement to check if each number is even or odd.
    - Print "Even" or "Odd" for each number.

3.  **Finding the Maximum:**
    - Given an array of numbers, use a `for` loop to find the largest number in the array.
    - Print the largest number to the console.
    - Example: `[5, 12, 8, 20, 3]` should print `20`.

**Intermediate:**

4.  **Looping Through an Array of Objects:**

    - Given an array of objects representing students (with `name` and `grade` properties), use a `for...of` loop to iterate through the array.
    - Inside the loop, use an `if` statement to check if the student's grade is greater than or equal to 90.
    - If the grade is 90 or above, print the student's name and grade.

5.  **Nested Loops (Creating a Pattern):**

    - Use nested `for` loops to create the following pattern:
      ```
      *
      **
      ***
      ****
      *****
      ```

6.  **`while` Loop with a Condition:**

    - Write a `while` loop that generates random numbers between 1 and 10 until it generates the number 7.
    - Print each generated number to the console, and then print a message when the number 7 is found.

7.  **`for...in` Loop (Object Iteration):**
    - Given an object representing a person (with `name`, `age`, and `city` properties), use a `for...in` loop to iterate through the object's properties.
    - Print each property name and its corresponding value to the console.

**Advanced:**

8.  **Break and Continue Statements:**

    - Write a `for` loop that iterates from 1 to 10.
    - Use a `break` statement to exit the loop when the number 5 is reached.
    - Use a `continue` statement to skip the number 3.
    - Print the numbers that are processed by the loop.

9.  **Do while loop with user input simulation:**
    - Simulate a user input loop. Create a do while loop that continues to prompt for a number until the user enters a number greater than 100. For each loop, print the current number.

**Hints and Explanations:**

- **`for` Loops:** Understand the initialization, condition, and increment/decrement parts of the loop.
- **`for...of` Loops:** Use them for iterating through arrays and iterable objects.
- **`for...in` Loops:** Use them for iterating through the properties of an object.
- **`while` Loops:** Use them when you don't know the number of iterations in advance.
- **`do...while` Loops:** Ensure that the code block is executed at least once.
- **`if` Statements:** Understand how to use conditional expressions to control the flow of your code.
- **`break` Statement:** Use it to exit a loop prematurely.
- **`continue` Statement:** Use it to skip the current iteration of a loop.
- **Nested Loops:** Understand how to use loops within loops to create complex patterns or iterate through multidimensional data.

These challenges will help you strengthen your understanding of loops and conditions in JavaScript. Good coding!
